    <h1>Welcome. A Brief History</h1>
    <p>On behalf of us: Safi Azam Hyun Joon Kim, Tanner Badey, and Luis Garcia. Thank you for visiting our website.</p>
    <p>This was a Game Engine built from scratch using what we learned in our Building Game Engines course at Northeastern University (Spring 2023 Merged Building Game Engines - CS 4850/5850). This course was taught by <a href="http://www.mshah.io/">Michael Shah</a> and it was fun learning about the possibilities of SDL</p>
    <p>This Engine was part of the final project for this course, which incorporates multiple elements such as the usage of SDL with C++, creating and managing a Resource Manager, player input, physics, framerate, working with Python, connect both languages using PyBind11, collaborating as a team effectively, and accomplishing this in 4 weeks.</p>
    <p>For all of us, this is a our first experience creating such an engine for the first time and are proud of what we have to show. Thank you so much for your interest.</p>

     <h1>Post Mortem</h1>
    <!-- Add a paragraph of text -->
    <p>Looking back at how the Compact Game Engine is at this released state, we are proud of how much was accomplished in just a few weeks. There is a GUI, even audio that works into the game, very compactly and we will we could have done more beyond, specifically in terms of customizability to current features and new features.</p>
    <p>Focusing on audio and level design and space, we would have liked the user to have more control over how big a level is. Our far-reach goal was for the user to input a custom size for the map, so they had full control over the size of the map but were also responsible if that space was playable or not. Due to GUI reasons, it was then lowered to having pre-set sizes that we know will work well with the GUI while also having control and variety. When it came to developing the engine, we were not able to derive the focus of this. As for audio, it would be awesome if the user could import any audio that they wanted for added customizability.</p>
    <p>Considering that our game is done in a 2D view, we understand that there are a lot of possibilities, one of the most common ones being platformers. Our engine was designed with a “top-view” perspective, so we would have liked to make those users implement games with gravity-like physics to work well with this engine. Beyond that, we would have hoped to add more fancy features like particles and screen shake.</p>
